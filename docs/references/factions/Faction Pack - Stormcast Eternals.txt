of the following units: formations led by Stormcasts of the Ruination chambers, warriors who have
seen battle so many times and whose souls have been so eroded that they are
GENERAL close to pure vessels of Sigmar’s will. Though their lack of humanity renders
Lord-Vigilant them ruthless, they are nigh incorruptible, their sense of self too diminished
on Gryph-stalker for Chaos to find true purchase. This allows them to traverse lands that are so
twisted that other warriors would soon wither or mutate upon entering them.

3 Prosecutors commanders are hewn from centuries of service, and they tread the thin
5 Liberators line between preserving humanity and achieving victory at all costs. Each
is chosen by their Gryph-stalker mount, creatures born under the waxing
of the fell moon Dharroth and that can detect which Stormcast souls are
most resistant to entropy. Swooping above them come Prosecutors wielding
flaming sigmarite spears. Though each is an exemplar of Sigmar’s creed,
their exposure to the Cursed Skies has transformed them into shells of their
former selves, leading them to pursue the eradication of Chaos at the expense
of all else. A Lord-Veritant always accompanies each Vigilant Brotherhood,
keeping watch over the state of their comrades’ fading identities whilst
adding their considerable might to the force. The final element of the
Brotherhood is a core of Liberators, unyielding champions of Order who have
perished again and again in defence of the Mortal Realms.
The Stormcast Eternals of studio editor Steve bear sigmarite armour with obsidian trim. The gemstone also features on
their bases, giving them a dark and foreboding appearance.
