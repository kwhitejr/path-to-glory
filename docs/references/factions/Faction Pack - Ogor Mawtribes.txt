GENERAL
 Tyrant
UNITS
 2 Mournfang Pack
 3 Ogor Gluttons
 3 Ogor Gluttons
 4 Leadbelchers
 1 Ironblaster
When an ogor Tyrant wishes to make himself heard, he speaks through
his tribe’s most devastating weapon: an ancient great-cannon known as an
Ironblaster. Ogors have a special love for blackpowder artillery pieces, for not
only do they make a most satisfying roar when fired, but each volley blasts
enemies into smoking gobbets of flesh – half-cooked and ready for eating.
To own even a single Ironblaster is a mark of great prestige amongst the
mawtribes, and Tyrants protect their assets on the battlefield by surrounding
them with a retinue of their toughest fighters, known as a Tyrant’s Bellow.
When prey is sighted, Mournfang Riders charge off to engage. They harry
their targets with gunshot and hacking blows, driving them out into the
open. It is then that the guns of the Tyrant’s Bellow open up en masse – not
just the Ironblaster itself but also the cannons wielded by the Leadbelchers,
lit tapers dangling from their slavering lips. This storm of metal and fire
reduces almost everything in its path to charred carrion, much to the amused
delight of the Tyrant. Belly rumbling eagerly, the oversized warlord then
advances at the head of his favoured Gluttons, hacking into pieces those foes
that still stand and selecting the choicest cuts of scorched meat for himself.

‘Hear that roar? That’s the sound of me Ironblasters, callin’ us to
the feast tables.’
– Tyrant Badgrulp Bearmuncher of the Meatfist

The ferocious warleaders of the
Gutbuster warglutts, Tyrants
are living mountains of iron and
blubbery flesh. Each has risen to
the heights of power by eating
their rivals and bullying their
tribe-mates into doing as they’re
told, and their bottomless
appetite can only be satisfied by
a lifestyle of constant plunder
and war. Despite their girth,
they move with surprising
speed, hacking their prey
into bloody chunks for easier
consumption and relying upon
a heavy gutplate – and several
thick layers of fat – to keep them
from harm.

CONTROL
The most destructive
blackpowder weapon deployed
by the Gutbuster warglutts,
the Ironblaster is an immense
cannon that hurls solid shot
into the heart of the enemy’s
ranks, blasting foes into
scraps of charred meat. Said
to be relics of the long-dead
Sky-Titans, these weapons are
seen as status symbols amongst
the mawtribes, and their
deafening roar has announced
the commencement of countless
gory feasts. Each is mounted
on a crude carriage and pulled
into battle by a rhinox, a badtempered beast of the frozen
plains that has all the aggression
of its ogor master and a
battering charge to back it up.

CONTROL
The blackpowder-obsessed
gunners known as Leadbelchers
lumber into battle, blasting
away with their massive guns
and utilising them as makeshift
bludgeons should the foe be
foolish enough to engage them in
hand-to-hand combat.

Ogor Gluttons are hulking,
muscle-bound brutes driven
entirely by an unending desire
for food. They thunder into
battle like an avalanche of
sweaty flesh, taking great
bites out of their foes even as
they attack with crude clubs
and cleavers.

One might as well try to stop
a boulder rolling down a
mountain as halt the charge
of an ogor mounted atop a
Mournfang. These beasts make
perfect linebreakers – they are
ornery in the extreme, feel little
in the way of pain, and possess
an appetite to rival that of
their riders.
