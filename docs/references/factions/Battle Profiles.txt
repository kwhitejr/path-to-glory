BATTLE PROFILES
On the following pages, you will find the battle profiles for most of the units that can be used in games of Warhammer Age
of Sigmar. The battle profiles are organised first by Grand Alliance and then alphabetically by faction. There are four Grand
Alliances: Order, Chaos, Death and Destruction. The Grand Alliance to which a unit belongs is determined by the keyword
listed on its warscroll. For example, the Vindictors warscroll has the Order keyword, so the battle profile for a Vindictors
unit can be found in the ‘Order’ section. As the unit belongs to the Stormcast Eternals faction, its entry is in the Stormcast
Eternals battle profile table.
All units in your army must be from the same faction, with the exception of Regiments of Renown (see below).
When we republish a set of battle profiles, the new version takes precedence over versions with an earlier publication date or
no publication date. Battle profiles that have changed since the previous version will be marked with a star (✹).
REGIMENTS OF RENOWN
Regiments of Renown are pre-built regiments made up of legendary units from across the Mortal Realms that you can ally into
your armies. In this document, you can find a list of Regiments of Renown that contains their points values, a summary of the
units that make up each regiment and any other notes, including which factions can take them. The rules for these Regiments
of Renown can be found on warhammer-community.com.
The following restrictions apply to Regiments of Renown:
• You cannot include more than 1 Regiment of Renown in your army unless otherwise specified in the notes column of that
regiment’s battle profile.
• Units in a Regiment of Renown cannot use (but can be picked as the target of, if otherwise eligible) any faction rules from the faction they
are allied into, including enhancements and lores, unless they have a keyword that matches that faction’s name.
• If an ability allows you to set up a replacement unit (Core Rules, 24.2) for a unit in a Regiment of Renown, that unit also counts as being
part of that Regiment of Renown.
WARHAMMER LEGENDS
Every Citadel Miniature is a unique piece of the ever-evolving narrative of Warhammer. It is,
then, an unfortunate truth that we can’t continue to sell and support every model we’ve ever
made indefinitely. As we make new models, and new books to explore their background and
rules, we have to stop producing and featuring some older models. But just like many of you,
we still treasure our collections of older Citadel Miniatures, and we still want to be able to
use them in games and forge glorious narratives on the tabletop!
This is where Warhammer Legends comes in: it gives us a place to publish rules that allow you
to play games with your older miniatures. In order to maintain a healthy game balance and a fair
playing field, Warhammer Legends units are not intended for competitive play and so will not
be legal at official Warhammer Age of Sigmar tournaments. Nevertheless, we encourage you to
continue to use your collection for casual play. Warhammer Legends battle profiles are organised
first by Grand Alliance and then alphabetically by faction. The rules for these units can be found
on warhammer-community.com.
KEY
Rules are updated regularly, with the type of change made indicated by one of the
following ‘badges’:
NEW
This shows that a new battle profile(s) has been added since the last
time this document was published.
UPDATED
This shows that an existing profile(s) has changed since the last
time this document was published.
More recent rules updates always take precedence over earlier versions.
