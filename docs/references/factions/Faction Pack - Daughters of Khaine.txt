HEARTFLAYER TROUPE
Eager for worthy kills to offer to their goddess, the most zealous disciples
This Spearhead army consists of Morathi-Khaine set out in Heartflayer Troupes to massacre her enemies.
of the following units: These Khainites are darting, blood-slick killers upon the battlefield,
eschewing heavy armour in order to maximise their dexterity and speed.
GENERAL Each Troupe is led by a Melusai Ironscale, most loyal of Morathi-Khaine’s
 Melusai Ironscale Scáthborn guard. These serpentine champions are powerhouses in their own
right, viciously striking down foes with their keldrisaíth staves or blasting
UNITS them from afar with bolts of umbral magic. They are backed up by the
 5 Witch Aelves Melusai archers known as Blood Stalkers, who pick off opponents from a
 5 Witch Aelves distance with preternatural skill, piercing hearts with enchanted arrows.
 5 Doomfire Warlocks
 5 Blood Stalkers Surging forward to break through the front lines are the Doomfire Warlocks,
incinerating enemies with flames made of pure shadow before beheading
stragglers with their darkly gleaming scimitars. Throngs of Witch Aelves
scream in their wake, eager to commit murder in the name of their bloody-
handed goddess. These priestesses of battle place great religious import on
wanton slaughter, and they will relentlessly stab and slice until they are
stained as red as the corpses that surround them.
‘Let us gouge out the hearts of these fools and offer them to the
Bloody-Handed One!’
– Cariadra Hagg-Mawr
Lead rules writer Matt’s paint scheme is inspired by Celtic traditional colours, representing a Khainite force from the
Aelfgrove Wetlands of Ghyran. He has applied blue warpaint to the skin of his aelves and used plenty of natural shades.
