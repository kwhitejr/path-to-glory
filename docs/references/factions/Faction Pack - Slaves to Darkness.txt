This Spearhead army consists conquering lands and slaughtering their rivals, they will eventually reach
of the following units: the final obstacle that lies before their ascension to daemonhood. Such a
fell blessing requires dedication tenfold compared to what hardships came
GENERAL before, and only feats of the most spectacular violence can hope to catch the
Chaos Lord Dark Pantheon’s eyes. Thus will a newly crowned Chaos Lord strike out in
order to seek the bloodiest battles and raise their own despoiling armies.

5 Chaos Warriors Chaos Lord at their head. With the Ruinous Powers watching their every
5 Chaos Warriors move, the Lord will cleave through front lines with their reaperblade,
5 Chaos Knights receiving bounteous blessings in exchange. The fighters that accompany this
champion are equal parts their soldiers and rivals, hoping to steal glory for
themselves. Alongside Chaos Warriors thunder Chaos Knights, towering
warriors atop gore-streaked steeds that shatter enemy formations with the
power of their charge. Should numerically superior foes seek to overwhelm
these elites, a rumbling Chaos Chariot will come to the fore. This heavy
war-carriage can bowl over and crush entire rows of infantry once it gathers
momentum, even as its riders lay about themselves with lash and spiked flail.
‘They will see me. Even if I have to damn a million souls,
they will see me.’
– Chaos Lord Eris Bloodwrath
Rules writer John started his Spearhead army with the aim of building it into a bigger force under the rule of Archaon
himself. To that end, he went for a quick but effective black armour recipe, with teal capes for a dramatic dash of colour.
