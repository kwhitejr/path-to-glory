Bladelords are amongst the most Sunmetal Greatblade: Flurry of Blows 3 3+ 44++ 11 11 AAnnttii--IInnffaannttrryy
elite Lumineth warriors. Each (+1 Rend)
has formed a deep connection
with the essence of their weapon
and views combat as a series of
elegant and artful equations.
To kill with the perfectly
calculated cut or degree of
force is seen as the greatest of
virtues – not out of a sense of
ego or self-aggrandisement, they
say, but because it brings them
closer to true enlightenment.
Bladelords serve as guardians
to the mages of the Scinari,
souls who share their quest for
mental perfection and will give
their lives in service of their
honoured charges.

The bow is considered a noble Vanari Dagger 1 3+ 4+ - 1 -
weapon in Lumineth society,
for the ability to send an arrow
soaring through the radiant

sensibilities – as does avoiding
the need to close with their
base adversaries. Sentinels are
the archers of the Vanari, each
having trained until they can
shoot a foe through the eye
from great distance. Their bows
use a complex series of strings
that allow them to moderate
range and power, and their
armour shines with the power
of Hysh, capable of temporarily
blinding any foes who weather
their storm of sunmetal-
tipped arrows.

The Auralan Wardens are
the lynchpins of the Vanari
military. These phalanxes of
skilled aelven warriors embody
the Tyrionic traditions of their
people; they do not flinch in
the face of danger, nor do they
hesitate to wield their pikes to
impale oncoming enemies. The
Wardens’ strength is built upon
unity of purpose and a discipline
that only those as long-lived as
the aelves can hope to master.
Empowered by the energies of
aetherquartz and the arcane
moonfire entrusted to their
High Warden, they are the proud
fortress wall upon which the
forces of disorder break.
