SAGA AXEBAND
All Fyreslayers long for their name to echo forever in the heroic legends of
This Spearhead army consists their lodge, remembered as a byword for martial skill and boldness. Saga
of the following units: Axebands are wandering groups of Berzerkers in search of such glory. They
are guided on their journey by a Battlesmith who bears witness to their
GENERAL deeds and who will one day honour the worthiest in the Hall of Fyre, thus
Battlesmith preserving their tale for all time.

5 Vulkite Berzerkers Berzerkers have a tendency to charge head-first at whatever threat presents

5 Vulkite Berzerkers into their flesh to keep them alive while they carve their foes into smoking
5 Vulkite Berzerkers chunks of meat. As the fighting rages, the Axeband’s Battlesmith bellows
tales of long-dead heroes that died in a manner befitting true offspring of
Grimnir. In so doing, they incite their companions to ever more magnificent
deeds, setting their runes ablaze with fervour. A band of Hearthguard
Berzerkers forms an honour guard around the Battlesmith, their two-handed
weapons lopping off the heads of any foe not cut down by their ward.
‘Well then, Sons of Grimnir – do you want to live forever?’
– Battlesmith Aurgi Cinder-eye of the Vostarg
Graphic designer Jim took a swig of magmalt ale and swore an oath to Grimnir before painting his Fyreslayers of the
Vostarg lodge, achieving great results in no time at all with a selection of warm-hued Contrast paints.
