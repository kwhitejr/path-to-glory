of battle sending them into an electrified
frenzy as they mutilate their foe.

Declare: Pick up to 3 friendly
Hedonites of Slaanesh units to be

Effect: The targets have the Euphoric
keyword for the rest of the battle round.
In addition, for each friendly unit you
pick, give your opponent 1 temptation
dice. During this battle round, instead
of making a wound roll, save roll, ward
roll or run roll, your opponent can use 1
temptation dice to replace the roll they
would have made with a 6, or instead
of making a charge roll they can use 2
temptation dice to replace 2 of the dice in
a charge roll with two 6s (other dice could
then be rolled normally). Rolls that have
been replaced count as unmodified rolls
and cannot be re-rolled. You cannot use
temptation dice to replace a re-roll.
Each time your opponent uses a
temptation dice, they must roll it. On a
1-2, your opponent’s roll is replaced by
that value instead of a 6, and you must
allocate D3 damage points to the unit for
which the roll was replaced immediately
after the ability used by that unit has been
resolved (ward rolls cannot be made for
those damage points).
At the end of the battle round, any
temptation dice that have not been used
are lost.

BLADES OF THE LURID DREAM
This Spearhead army consists
of the following units:
GENERAL
 Shardspeaker of Slaanesh
UNITS
 5 Blissbarb Archers with 1
Blissbrew Homonculus
 5 Blissbarb Archers
 5 Slickblade Seekers
 3 Slaangor Fiendbloods
Slaanesh, the loathsome yet beguiling Dark Prince of the Ruinous Powers,
excels in ensnaring mortals. He whispers that they might slake their most
salacious desires, if only they should enter into his service. For many who
endure existences of privation and drudgery, it is an offer too tempting
to resist. Reality becomes a phantasmagoric paradise of revelry to these
Sybarites, every torment theirs to inflict and have inflicted upon them. Many
form warbands who seek to inhabit this blissful dream-state for eternity –
and drag more noble souls down into the depths of their depravity.
It is the Shardspeakers who direct these packs of murderous libertines
and who channel the power of the Dark Prince like a powerful intoxicant.
Through clouds of incense dart Blissbarb Archers, whose arrows are smeared
with poisons that distort the senses. Only then do the elite of the Sybarites
move in for the kill. Disdainful laughter echoes as Slickblade Seekers sprint
forwards to slice off heads, herding surviving prey towards their doom. That
doom is delivered by the Slaangor Fiendbloods. The arrival of these trilling
beast-kin is the breaking point for the foe; some weep in terror, some cry
out in joy and try desperately to embrace them. All are ripped asunder, their
dream turning to a gruesome nightmare in their agonised final moments.

‘Swiftly, my paramours! The Dark Prince spies unfortunates
stooped beneath the weight of reality. We must save them from
their sanity!’
– Hiraxith of the Six Slicing Shards
Wherever the Hedonites of Slaanesh roam, reality is
unmade. Those who stand against them are assailed by
titillating phantasms and mind-bending illusions until
they become slaves to their own base urges.
You receive 6 temptation dice at the start of the battle
round. Each time your opponent makes a failed hit
roll, a failed wound roll or a failed save roll, you can
offer them a temptation dice. If they accept your offer,
that roll is replaced with a 6. Rolls replaced in this way
cannot be re-rolled or modified.
Each time your opponent accepts your offer of a
temptation dice, you gain D6 depravity points. Each
time your opponent rejects your offer of a temptation
dice, inflict D3 mortal damage on the unit for which the
roll was made.

You cannot offer your opponent a temptation dice for
the same enemy unit more than once per phase. At
the end of the battle round, all remaining temptation
dice are lost.
All friendly units gain passive abilities from the table
below based on the number of depravity points you
have. These abilities are cumulative.

Sybarite carnivals. They make

CONTROL
The Slaangor Fiendbloods are
towering beastmen utterly
in thrall to the Lord of Dark
Delights. With an animalistic
lack of restraint, they have
over-indulged until only the
most visceral and torturous of
sensations can now rouse them.
Slaangors roam Slaaneshi camps
in a glassy-eyed stupor, allowing
fellow Sybarites to drape them
in fi ne gems and silks. When
battle beckons, a transformation
seizes them; they become
arrow-swift instruments of
manic violence, barrelling
forwards without a hint of selfpreservation in their maddened
desire to feel anything at all.

CONTROL
Blissbarb Archers are the
footsoldiers of Slaanesh’s mortal
hosts, the sinful masses who
partake in the bacchanals and
the carnivals of agony. Having
abandoned their past lives,
these fleet-footed Sybarites are
single-minded in their pursuit
of decadence. Though forbidden
from engaging in the glorious
sensations of melee by their
cruel overlords – though many
cannot help but seek to wet
their daggers when opportunity
arises – they instead assail the
foe with barbed arrows, laced
with hallucinogenic toxins that
open the mind to new vistas of
dark possibility.
