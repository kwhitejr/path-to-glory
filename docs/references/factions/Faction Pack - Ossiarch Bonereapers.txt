Harvester has a far more straightforward purpose: this construct-beast wades
into the fray with scythes and mauls swinging, its subsidiary limbs snatching
up bloodied bones for processing. Tithe-Reaper Echelons are commanded by
Mortisan Soulreapers. When the enemy has been pushed to breaking point,
these mages will step into the fray themselves, acquiring a harvest of souls
with their fell scythes.
‘Let us be done with this, and swiftly. Lord Xornas requires

Army painter Nathan had to paint his Gothizzar Harvester twice, after his dog mangled the first! To capture the amber
blades of the Ivory Host, he shaded them Skrag Brown, before picking out the cracks with Screaming Skull.
