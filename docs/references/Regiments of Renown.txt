SAVIOURS OF CINDERFALL
The backstreets and catacombs of the God-King’s free cities conceal innumerable threats, from lurking
monsters to hidden cults. It is the duty of the Saviours of Cinderfall to root out these horrors with blade

VEREMORD’S SHAMBLERS
Crypt-keepers dread the coming of Veremord. This student of necromancy is a master at breaking wards set
around tombs and corpse-pits, pilfering the bodies within for his growing horde. Key to Veremord’s success
is the arcane smoke that billows from his Corpse Cart, vapours that eat through magical defences.

BIG GRIKK’S KRULESHOTS
Grikk swears that the massive, jagged bolt that buried itself in the back of his boss’s Vulcha steed had nothing
to do with him. Few believed the treacherous Big Shot, so Grikk quickly took leave of his clan, accompanied
by a handful of crossbow-toting lackeys and some grots to drag his beloved killbow across the realms.
